# Neural Architecture Search (NAS) 

## Goal 
To automatically search a network architecture that leads to the best accuracy. 

## Architecture Options
Blocks: residual block , inception block, bottleneck block, etc. <br>
Layers: convs, pooling, fc, etc.<br>
Hyperparameters: number of filters, size of kernel, stride, padding, etc.<br>

## Search space
The set containing all the possible architectures <br><br>
Example of constructing search space 
```python
# import nni.retiarii.nn.pytorch as nn
self.layer = nn.LayerChoice([
    ops.PoolBN('max', channels, 3, stride, 1),
    ops.SepConv(channels, channels, 3, stride, 1),
    nn.Identity()
])
```
