# Pruning 
### Goal: 
Aim to remove unimportant channels while minimizing the reconstruction error  <br>

### Ranking algorithm: 
To rank the importance of every channel (ex: L1, L2, APOz, FPGM, etc.) <br>
Example of channel pruning, for more details, please refer to [NNI](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/pruning_quick_start_mnist.html)
```python 
from nni.compression.pytorch.pruning import L1NormPruner
pruner = L1NormPruner(model, config_list)
# compress the model and generate the masks
_, masks = pruner.compress()
```
